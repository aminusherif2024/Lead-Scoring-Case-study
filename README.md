A case study to help improve the lead conversion rate which is currently at 30% for an education company called X Education.
We have been provided a sample data set of existing leads.
After performing EDA on the data set, a ML model based on Logistic Regression was created to predict the lead conversion with nearly 80% accuracy.
This will help the sales team focus on those leads which have been precited to have higher probability of conversion.
